To install Slingscold from the source, you need to compile it.

== Dependencies ==
[Fedora]
 - cmake
 - libgee-devel
 - gnome-menus-devel
 - cdbs
 - vala
 - libvala-devel
 - glib-devel
 - libwnck-devel
 - gtk3-devel

[Ubuntu]
 - cmake
 - libgee-0.8-dev
 - libgnome-menu-3-dev
 - cdbs
 - valac
 - libvala-<version>-dev
 - libglib2.0-dev
 - libwnck-3-dev
 - libgtk-3-dev

== Compilation ==

- First, we need a build directory:
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
- Then, configure CMake:
    $ cmake ..
  ** Here, you can get some errors if you don't have all the dependencies.
- Compile it:
    $ make
  ** You can also use make -j3 if you have a dual core. (it will be much faster)

== Launch Slingscold ==

- Just run Slingscold:
    ./slingscold

== Install Slingscold in the System ==

- With the administrator rights, use:
    # make install
    Or:
    $ sudo make install

- You can now launch Slingscold using:
    $ slingscold
  ** in the command line or using the application icon installed
